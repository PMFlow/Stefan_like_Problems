# Stefan_like_Problems
## Data repository accompanying the paper "Global random walks for one-dimensional one-phase Stefan-like
moving-boundary problems: Simulation results" by Nicolae Suciu, Surendra Nepal, Yosief Wondmagegne, 
Magnus Â¨Ogren, and Adrian Muntean

# The repository contains Matlab codes based on Global Random Walk (GRW) algorithms to solve Stefan-like problems, 
organizsed in the following folders:

- 'Stefan' - classical Stefan problem

- 'Stefan_kinetic' - stefan problem with a kinetic condition

- 'Rubber' - diffusion in rubber
