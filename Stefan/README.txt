This folder contains the following Matlab scrips and files:


'main_Stefan.m' is the main code used to compute the solution s(t) stored in 'sGRW.mat' for comparisons 
	with the analytical solution 's1RW_ana.mat' and the random walk solution 's1RW.mat' given in ref. [21]

'comparison_s.m' compares the three solutions s(t).

'main_Stefan_conv.m' is the main code to assess estimated orders of convergence (EOC) for Stefan problem.

'BGRW_1D.m' and 'GRW_1D.m' are functions for the biased- and unbiased-GRW solutions of the diffusion problem 
	used in the main codes. 
'plot_c.m' plots the solution 'concentration.mat' of the main codes. 

'm_Stefan.png' and 's_Stefan.png' are plots of the temperature- and diffusion front-solutions.
